Left to right: Falcon 9 v1.0, v1.1, v1.2 "Full Thrust", Falcon 9 Block 5, Falcon Heavy, and Falcon Heavy Block 5.
Since June 2010, rockets from the Falcon 9 family have been launched 210 times, with 208 full mission successes, one partial failure and one total loss of the spacecraft. In addition, one rocket and its payload were destroyed on the launch pad during the fueling process before a static fire test was set to occur.

Designed and operated by private manufacturer SpaceX, the Falcon 9 rocket family includes the retired versions Falcon 9 v1.0, v1.1, and v1.2 "Full Thrust" Block 1 to 4, along with the currently active Block 5 evolution. Falcon Heavy is a heavy-lift derivative of Falcon 9, combining a strengthened central core with two Falcon 9 first stages as the side boosters.[1]

The Falcon design features reusable first-stage boosters, which land either on a ground pad near the launch site or on a drone ship at sea.[2] In December 2015, Falcon 9 became the first rocket to land propulsively after delivering a payload into orbit.[3] This reusability has resulted in significantly reduced launch costs.[4][5] Falcon family core boosters have successfully landed 173 times in 184 attempts. A total of 36 boosters have flown multiple missions, with a record of 15 missions by the same booster.

Falcon 9's typical missions include cargo delivery and crewed flights to the International Space Station (ISS) with the Dragon and Dragon 2 capsules, launch of communications satellites and Earth observation satellites to geostationary transfer orbits (GTO), and low Earth orbits (LEO), some of them at a polar inclination. The heaviest payload launched to LEO is a batch of 56 Starlink v1.5 satellites weighing a total of around 17,400 kg (38,400 lb) on 26 January 2023.[6] The heaviest payload launched to a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) was Intelsat 35e with 6,761 kg (14,905 lb).[a] Launches to higher orbits have included the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) probe to the Sun–Earth Lagrange point L1, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) space telescope on a lunar flyby trajectory, the Falcon Heavy test flight which launched Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster into a heliocentric orbit extending beyond the orbit of Mars, and Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) into the minor-planet moon Dimorphos of the double asteroid Didymos.

Launch statistics
Rockets from the Falcon 9 family have been launched 210 times over 13 years, resulting in 208 full mission successes (99%), one partial success (SpaceX CRS-1 delivered its cargo to the International Space Station (ISS), but a secondary payload was stranded in a lower-than-planned orbit), and one full failure (the SpaceX CRS-7 spacecraft was lost in flight in an explosion). Additionally, one rocket and its payload AMOS-6 were destroyed before launch in preparation for an on-pad static fire test. The currently active version, Falcon 9 Block 5, has flown 149 missions, all full successes.

In 2022 Falcon 9 set a new record of 60 launches (all successful) by the same launch vehicle type in a calendar year. The previous record was held by Soyuz-U, which had 47 launches (45 successful) in 1979.[7]

The first rocket version Falcon 9 v1.0 was launched five times from June 2010 to March 2013, its successor Falcon 9 v1.1 15 times from September 2013 to January 2016, and the Falcon 9 Full Thrust 185 times from December 2015 to present. The latest Full Thrust variant, Block 5, was introduced in May 2018.[8] While the Block 4 boosters were only flown twice and required several months of refurbishment, Block 5 versions are designed to sustain 10 flights with just some inspections.[9]

The Falcon Heavy derivative consists of a strengthened Falcon 9 first stage as its center core, with two additional Falcon 9 first stages attached and used as boosters, both of which are fitted with an aerodynamic nosecone instead of a usual Falcon 9 interstage.[10]

Falcon 9 first-stage boosters landed successfully in 173 of 184 attempts (94%), with 145 out of 150 (96.7%) for the Falcon 9 Block 5 version. A total of 149 re-flights of first stage boosters have all successfully launched their payloads.

2020
In late 2019, Gwynne Shotwell stated that SpaceX hoped for as many as 24 launches for Starlink satellites in 2020,[11] in addition to 14 or 15 non-Starlink launches. At 26 launches, 14 of which were for Starlink satellites, Falcon 9 had its most prolific year, and Falcon rockets were second most prolific rocket family of 2020, only behind China's Long March rocket family.[12]

An atmospheric test of the Dragon 2 abort system after Max Q. The capsule fired its SuperDraco engines, reached an apogee of 40 km (25 mi), deployed parachutes, and splashed down in the ocean 31 km (19 mi) downrange from the launch site. The test was previously slated to be accomplished with the Crew Dragon Demo-1 capsule;[20] but that test article exploded during a ground test of SuperDraco engines on 20 April 2019.[21] The abort test used the capsule originally intended for the first crewed flight.[22] As expected, the booster was destroyed by aerodynamic forces after the capsule aborted.[23] First flight of a Falcon 9 with only one functional stage — the second stage had a mass simulator in place of its engine.

(ground pad)
Last launch of phase 1 of the CRS contract. Carries Bartolomeo, an ESA platform for hosting external payloads onto ISS.[31] Originally scheduled to launch on 2 March 2020, the launch date was pushed back due to a second stage engine failure. SpaceX decided to swap out the second stage instead of replacing the faulty part.[32] It was SpaceX's third flight of the Dragon C112 and the last launch of the cargo Dragon spacecraft.

Fifth operational launch of Starlink satellites. It was the first time a first stage booster flew for a fifth time and the second time the fairings were reused (Starlink flight in May 2019).[34] Towards the end of the first stage burn, the booster suffered premature shut down of an engine, the first of a Merlin 1D variant and first since the CRS-1 mission in October 2012. However, the payload still reached the targeted orbit.[35] This was the second Starlink launch booster landing failure in a row, later revealed to be caused by residual cleaning fluid trapped inside a sensor.[36]

(drone ship)
Launched the largest, high-power broadcasting satellite for SiriusXM's digital audio radio service (DARS). SXM-7 was built by Maxar Technologies; intended to operate in the S-band spectrum, it will replace the SXM-3 satellite. The satellite will deliver the highest power density of any commercial satellite on-orbit,[122] generate more than 20 kW of power, and have a large unfoldable antenna reflector, which enables broadcast to radios without the need for large dish-type antennas on the ground. Due to the heavy weight, the payload was injected into a sub-synchronous orbit of 224 km × 19,411 km (139 mi × 12,061 mi) and the satellite itself will transfer to full GTO.[123] It was the first time a commercial primary payload flew on a booster which had been flown more than 4 times before.[124] First dedicated customer launch where the fairings were previously used.[125]

A hole in a heat-shielding engine cover, which likely developed through fatigue, allowed recirculating hot exhaust gases to damage one of the Merlin 1D first-stage engines, causing it to shut down early during ascent. Engine-out capability of the Falcon 9 allowed the mission to continue and successfully deploy the 60 Starlink satellites to orbit.[155] The issue caused the booster to fail its landing attempt and miss the droneship Of Course I Still Love You (OCISLY) after its entry burn, breaking the longest streak of 24 landing successes (since surpassed).[156] During this mission, GO Ms. Tree and GO Ms. Chief were used for the last time to recover the fairings;[157][158] SpaceX retired the fairing catching program in favor of fairing fishing.[159] Both fairing catching ships were retired from SpaceX use.

Fourth of six new cargo missions NASA awarded in 2015 to SpaceX under the CRS-2 contract to be flown after the initial 20 missions of phase 1 were completed in 2020.[193] First time SpaceX launched 5 rockets within the same calendar month. The ELaNa 38 mission, consisting of 4 cubesats, launched on this flight.[264] SpaceX achieved the feat of 100 successful orbital rocket booster landings in this mission, coinciding with the 6th anniversary of its first booster landing. The rough seas led to the Octograbber robot not being able to secure the booster to the deck, leading to both the booster, droneship and the Octagrabber robot being heavily damaged in transit.[263]
2022
In addition to launches from Vandenberg, SpaceX reflected up to 60 launches each year from its two Florida launch sites when it filed its environmental assessment in February 2020.[129] In January 2022, information became public that SpaceX intended to increase the pace of launches to 52 during 2022, after launching a record 31 times in 2021.[265] In March 2022, Elon Musk stated that SpaceX was aiming for 60 Falcon launches in 2022.[266] In the event, SpaceX did increase their launch cadence, exceeding the previous yearly record of 31 launches in just the first 29 weeks of 2022.[267] There were 61 Falcon launches in 2022: one Falcon Heavy and 60 Falcon 9. 13 of the Falcon 9 launches were from Vandenberg.

Mission launched the first Globalstar satellite since 2013, a spare satellite that was still waiting on ground for its launch.[338] The mission was not known by the public until early June, when a FCC filing appeared.[342] The low mass of the satellite, together with the lack of return to the launch site and the use of an unconventional payload dispenser, led to speculations about there being a second, undisclosed governmental payload.[343] After launch, four USA designated satellites were cataloged, confirming the presence of four secret US Government payloads that were released between second-stage cutoff 1 and second-stage startup 2.[340][276][341] Likely the satellites were test satellites built by SpaceX based on the Starshield bus (based on Starlink Block v1.5 or v2.0 technology), based on the deployment structure seen in the launch video.[275] Their purpose has not been revealed, but is likely either technical demonstration, communications, earth observation or signals intelligence. SpaceX set a new record for the shortest time between two Falcon 9 launches at 14 hours and 8 minutes. The previous record time was 15 hours and 17 minutes, set between the Starlink Group 4-4 and Türksat 5B missions.

Classified payload totaling 3,750 kg (8,270 lb) using new side boosters and center core. The core lacked any fins and landing gear, as it was deliberately expended, underwent the most energetic reentry, and impacted at 1,300 km (810 mi) downrange, 8.3% further than STP-2 mission,[413] while the two side boosters were recovered, marking the 150th and 151st successful landing respectively, and 21st landing at LZ-1 and 4th at LZ-2. It was the 50th launch of a Falcon-family rocket this year. The launch carried Shepherd Demonstration for the Space Force, intended to "test new technologies to enhance safe and responsible rendezvous and proximity operations",[414] as well as the LDPE-2 space tug (with hosted payloads), Tetra-1,[415] Alpine, LINUSS A1 and A2. The flight featured a Falcon mission-extension kit, which equipped the second stage with a dark-painted band (for thermal control), extra COPVs for pressurization control, and additional TEA-TEB ignition fluid.

Israeli electro-optical Earth observation satellite based on the OPTSAT-3000 satellite. This was the first SpaceX launch to a low-inclination retrograde orbit, previous retrograde orbits having been polar or Sun-synchronous. It targeting an ~140° inclination orbit. This launch marked the first time SpaceX completed 7 launches in a calendar month and the final rocket launch of 2022. SpaceX's Falcon family thus equaled the world record for most successful launches by any rocket family, first set by the R-7 family in 1980 after this launch. B1061 became the only booster to land on all of SpaceX’s different landing zones and drone ships except the rarely used LZ-2.
2023
There have been, to date, 12 launches in 2023, while Elon Musk has said that the company will attempt to launch 100 rockets (may include Starship) this year.[450] SpaceX had a rare coincidence of four rockets (all types of operational and under-development rockets) on all four of its orbital launch pads and two Dragon 2s (both types of Dragon 2s) on orbit on 10 January 2023.[451]

Future launches
Future launches are listed chronologically when firm plans are in place. The order of the later launches is much less certain, as the official SpaceX manifest does not include a schedule.[200] Tentative launch dates are cited from various sources for each launch.[491][492][486][493] Launches are expected to take place "no earlier than" (NET) the listed date. The number of Starlink satellites per launch indicated with an ~ is an expectation based on previous launches to the same orbit, as the exact number is rarely published more than three days in advance.

Launch of Falcon 9 Flight 1 with a boilerplate Dragon

Dragon CRS-1 berthed to the International Space Station (ISS) on 14 October 2012, photographed from the Cupola.
On 4 June 2010, the first Falcon 9 launch successfully placed a test payload into the intended orbit.[651] The second launch of Falcon 9 was COTS Demo Flight 1, which placed an operational Dragon capsule in orbit on 8 December 2010.[652] The capsule re-entered the atmosphere after two orbits, allowing for testing the reentry procedures. The capsule was recovered off the coast of Mexico[653] and then placed on display at SpaceX headquarters.[654] The remaining objectives of the NASA COTS qualification program were combined into a single Dragon C2+ mission, on the condition that all milestones would be validated in space before berthing Dragon to the ISS.[655] The Dragon capsule was propelled to orbit in May 2012, and following successful tests in the next days it was grabbed with the station's robotic arm (Canadarm2) and docked to the ISS docking port for the first time on 25 May. After successfully completing all the return procedures, the recovered Dragon C2+ capsule was put on display at Kennedy Space Center.[656] Thus, Falcon 9 and Dragon became the first fully commercially developed launcher to deliver a payload to the International Space Station, paving the way for SpaceX and NASA to sign the first Commercial Resupply Services agreement for cargo deliveries.[657]

The first operational cargo resupply mission to ISS, the fourth flight of Falcon 9, was launched in October 2012. But an engine suffered a loss of pressure at 76 seconds after liftoff, which caused an automatic shutdown of that engine, but the remaining eight first-stage engines continued to burn and the Dragon capsule reached orbit successfully and thus demonstrated the rocket's "engine out" capability in flight.[658] Due to ISS visiting vehicle safety rules, at NASA's request, the secondary payload Orbcomm-2 was released into a lower-than-intended orbit.[659] Despite this incident, Orbcomm said they gathered useful test data from the mission and later in 2014, launched more satellites via SpaceX.[660] The mission continued to rendezvous and berth the Dragon capsule with the ISS where the ISS crew unloaded its payload and reloaded the spacecraft with cargo for return to Earth.[661]

Following unsuccessful attempts at recovering the first stage with parachutes, SpaceX upgraded to a much larger first stage booster and with greater thrust, termed Falcon 9 v1.1, and performed a demonstration flight of this version in September 2013.[662] After the second stage separation and delivering CASSIOPE, a very small payload relative to the rocket's capability, SpaceX conducted a novel high-altitude, high-velocity flight test wherein the booster attempted to reenter the lower atmosphere in a controlled manner and decelerate to a simulated over-water landing.[663]

Loss of CRS-7 mission

Main article: SpaceX CRS-7
In June 2015, Falcon 9 Flight 19 carried a Dragon capsule on the seventh Commercial Resupply Services mission to the ISS. The second stage disintegrated due to an internal helium tank failure while the first stage was still burning normally. This was the first (and only as of January 2023,) primary mission loss for any Falcon 9 rocket.[664] In addition to ISS consumables and experiments, this mission carried the first International Docking Adapter (IDA-1), whose loss delayed preparedness of the station's US Orbital Segment (USOS) for future crewed missions.[665]

Performance was nominal until T+140 seconds into launch when a cloud of white vapor appeared, followed by rapid loss of second-stage LOX tank pressure. The booster continued on its trajectory until complete vehicle breakup at T+150 seconds. The Dragon capsule was ejected from the disintegrating rocket and continued transmitting data until impact with the ocean. SpaceX officials stated that the capsule could have been recovered if the parachutes had deployed; however, the Dragon software did not include any provisions for parachute deployment in this situation.[666] Subsequent investigations traced the cause of the accident to the failure of a strut that secured a helium bottle inside the second-stage LOX tank. With the helium pressurization system integrity breached, excess helium quickly flooded the tank, eventually causing it to burst from overpressure.[667][668] NASA's independent accident investigation into the loss of SpaceX CRS-7 found that the failure of the strut which led to the breakup of the Falcon-9 represented a design error. Specifically, that industrial grade stainless steel had been used in a critical load path under cryogenic conditions and flight conditions, without additional part screening, and without regard to manufacturer recommendations.[669]

Full-thrust version and first booster landings
Main articles: Falcon 9 flight 20 and SpaceX CRS-8

Falcon 9 Flight 20 historic first-stage landing at CCSFS Landing Zone 1, 22 December 2015
After pausing launches for months, SpaceX launched on 22 December 2015, the highly anticipated return-to-flight mission after the loss of CRS-7. This launch inaugurated a new Falcon 9 Full Thrust version of its flagship rocket featuring increased performance, notably thanks to subcooling of the propellants. After launching a constellation of 11 Orbcomm-OG2 second-generation satellites,[670] the first stage performed a controlled-descent and landing test for the eighth time, SpaceX attempted to land the booster on land for the first time. It managed to return the first stage successfully to the Landing Zone 1 at Cape Canaveral, marking the first successful recovery of a rocket first stage that launched a payload to orbit.[671] After recovery, the first stage booster performed further ground tests and then was put on permanent display outside SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California.[672]

On 8 April 2016, SpaceX delivered its commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station marking the return-to-flight of the Dragon capsule, after the loss of CRS-7. After separation, the first-stage booster slowed itself with a boostback maneuver, re-entered the atmosphere, executed an automated controlled descent and landed vertically onto the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You, marking the first successful landing of a rocket on a ship at sea.[673] This was the fourth attempt to land on a drone ship, as part of the company's experimental controlled-descent and landing tests.[674]

Loss of AMOS-6 on the launch pad
Main article: AMOS-6
On 1 September 2016, the 29th Falcon 9 rocket exploded on the launchpad while propellant was being loaded for a routine pre-launch static fire test. The payload, Israeli satellite AMOS-6, partly commissioned by Facebook, was destroyed with the launcher.[675] On 2 January 2017, SpaceX released an official statement indicating that the cause of the failure was a buckled liner in several of the COPV tanks, causing perforations that allowed liquid and/or solid oxygen to accumulate underneath the COPVs carbon strands, which were subsequently ignited possibly due to friction of breaking strands.[676]

Zuma launch controversy
Main article: Zuma (satellite)
Zuma was a classified United States government satellite and was developed and built by Northrop Grumman at an estimated cost of US$3.5 billion.[677] Its launch, originally planned for mid-November 2017, was postponed to 8 January 2018 as fairing tests for another SpaceX customer were assessed. Following a successful Falcon 9 launch, the first-stage booster landed at LZ-1.[678] Unconfirmed reports suggested that the Zuma spacecraft was lost,[679] with claims that either the payload failed following orbital release, or that the customer-provided adapter failed to release the satellite from the upper stage, while other claims argued that Zuma was in orbit and operating covertly.[679] SpaceX's COO Gwynne Shotwell stated that their Falcon 9 "did everything correctly" and that "Information published that is contrary to this statement is categorically false".[679] A preliminary report indicated that the payload adapter, modified by Northrop Grumman after purchasing it from a subcontractor, failed to separate the satellite from the second stage under the zero gravity conditions.[680][677] Due to the classified nature of the mission, no further official information is expected.[679]

Falcon Heavy test flight
Main article: Falcon Heavy test flight

The maiden launch of the Falcon Heavy occurred on 6 February 2018, marking the launch of the most powerful rocket since the Saturn V, with a theoretical payload capacity to low Earth orbit more than double the Delta IV Heavy.[681][682] Both side boosters landed nearly simultaneously after a ten-minute flight. The central core failed to land on a floating platform at sea.[683] The rocket carried a car and a mannequin to an eccentric heliocentric orbit that reaches further than aphelion of Mars.[684]

First crewed flights
Main articles: Crew Dragon Demo-1 and Crew Dragon Demo-2
On 2 March 2019, SpaceX launched its first orbital flight of Dragon 2 (Crew Dragon). It was an uncrewed mission to the International Space Station. The Dragon contained a mannequin named Ripley, which was equipped with multiple sensors to gather data about how a human would feel during the flight. Along with the mannequin was 300 pounds of cargo of food and other supplies.[685] Also on board was Earth plush toy referred to as a "Super high tech zero-g indicator".[686] The toy became a hit with astronaut Anne McClain, who showed the plushy on the ISS each day[687] and also deciding to keep it on board to experience the crewed SpX-DM2.

The Dragon spent six days in space, including five days docked to the International Space Station. During the time, various systems were tested to make sure the vehicle was ready for US astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to fly in it in 2020. The Dragon undocked and performed a re-entry burn before splashing down on 8 March 2019, at 08:45 EST, 320 km (200 mi) off the coast of Florida.[688]

SpaceX held a successful launch of the first commercial orbital human space flight on 30 May 2020, crewed with NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken. Both astronauts focused on conducting tests on the Crew Dragon capsule. Crew Dragon successfully returned to Earth, splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico on 2 August 2020.[689]

Reuse of the first stage
Main articles: SpaceX reusable launch system development program and List of Falcon 9 first-stage boosters
SpaceX has developed a program to reuse the first-stage booster, setting multiple booster reflight records:

B1021 became, on 30 March 2017, the first booster to be successfully recovered a second time, on Flight 32 launching the SES-10 satellite. After that, it was retired and put on display at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.[690]
B1046, the first Block 5 booster, became the first to launch three times, carrying Spaceflight SSO-A on 3 December 2018.
B1048 was the first booster to be recovered four times on 11 November 2019, and the first to perform a fifth flight on 18 March 2020, but the booster was lost during re-entry.
B1049 was the first booster to be recovered five times on 4 June 2020, six times on 18 August 2020, and seven times on 25 November 2020.
B1051 became the first booster to be recovered eight times on 20 January 2021, nine times on 14 March 2021, and ten times on 9 May 2021, achieving one of SpaceX's milestone goals for reuse. It then became the first booster to be recovered eleven times on 18 December 2021, and twelve times on 19 March 2022.[691][692][693][694]
B1060 became the first booster to be recovered 13 times on 17 June 2022.
B1058 became the first booster to be recovered 14 times on 11 September 2022, and 15 times on 17 December 2022..
B1062 booster holds the record for fastest turnaround at 21 days. It launched on 8 April and again on 29 April 2022.[318]
